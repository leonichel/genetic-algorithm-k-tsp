# Genetic Algorithm To Solve The k-TSP 
This repository contains the experiment of a new solution for the Traveling Salesman Subset Problem (OTSSP or k-TSP) using a combination of genetic algorithms and the nearest neighbor algorithm. It introduces three new features: 
  * Crossover operator
  * Variable mutation probability
  * Mutation operator that adds a new city

Comparative experiments were carried out in several instances of the problem, demonstrating superior performance in 61.11% of the cases compared to the [Singamsetty et al. 2021](https://doi.org/10.5267/j.jpm.2021.5.002).
